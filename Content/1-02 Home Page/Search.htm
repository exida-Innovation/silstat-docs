        <p>SILstat’s Home Page includes a Search feature you can use to search within the full application. If desired, you can filter and search specifically within All, SILstat, Events, and Admin Center.</p>
        <p>Selecting the ‘SILstat’ filter will show results from SILstat excluding Events and Admin Center. Selecting the ‘Events’ filter will show results from Collection events.  Selecting the ‘Admin Center’ filter will show results from Users and User Roles. You can also filter by label.</p>
        <p>When typing keywords into the search box, you will immediately begin seeing results with the keywords highlighted to match. The search results display breadcrumbs where you can find where the results are located, as well as the full name, description, and associated labels.</p>
