        <p>Hazard Events can be initiated in the Collection section, by selecting the <i>Hazard</i> button. Alternatively, Hazard Events can be initiated by navigating through the hierarchy and selecting a Hazard Scenario or Initiating Event Node. See section <MadCap:xref href="RecordingEvents.htm" class="Chapter_Section"><i>1.1  
            Recording Events</i></MadCap:xref> for Event options included in each Hierarchy view.</p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once initiated, the Hazard Event view will show on the right-hand side of the application. Here you can specify the details of the event:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Where</b> section allows you to specify the Hazard Scenario or Initiating Event Node. For Events initiated through the hierarchy, the selected node will be listed. If not yet specified, select the ‘Select Where’ button. A plant hierarchy view will appear in a panel to the far right. Navigate through the hierarchy to find the Hazard Scenario or Initiating Event Node. Once finished with your selection, press Next. An indication that the step is complete is shown, and the section will collapse to show the next step.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">When</b> section allows you to specify the Hazard Date. By default, the date is the current date. You can select the ‘Show Time’ toggle switch to enter a Time. You can select the ‘Date Range’ toggle switch to specify a Start and End date. By default, the date range is one day. Once finished with your selection, press Next. An indication that the step is complete is shown, and the section will collapse to show the next step.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Safeguards</b> section provides a diagram showing your Hazard Scenario. The diagram displays Initiating Events and Safeguards associated with the Hazard. An Advanced view of the diagram shows Enabling Conditions, Conditional Modifiers, and Safeguards that are not credited for this Hazard. If a Safeguard succeeded at the time of the Hazard, select that safeguard in the diagram. This provides options to indicate if the safeguard partially succeeded or succeeded. SILstat will assume safeguards preceding the successful safeguard failed, and safeguards listed after were not called to action.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Details</b> section includes all relevant information for this event. You can specify a Name, Description, and include Common Properties (Custom Data, Resources, References, Labels) for the event.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once each section is completed, press Confirm at either the top or bottom of the screen. Upon confirmation, a Resolution section appears. This shows all failed devices associated with the Hazard Event, including their Tag, Name, Initiating Event, and Hazard. In the <i>Failure Event</i> column, select <i>New</i> to initiate a Failure Collection event. Any associated Repair or Replacement event will show in the <i>Resolution</i> column. See section <MadCap:xref href="EventFailure.htm" class="Chapter_Section_NumberOnly"><i>1.1 </i></MadCap:xref>, <MadCap:xref href="EventRepair.htm" class="Chapter_Section_NumberOnly"><i>1.1 </i></MadCap:xref>, and <MadCap:xref href="EventReplace.htm" class="Chapter_Section_NumberOnly"><i>1.1 </i> </MadCap:xref>respectively, for more details on the Failure, Repair, and Replace Events.</p>
        <p>As SILstat processes the event, the following notifications may be provided:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The event is queued for processing.</li>
                <li>The event has been successfully completed.</li>
                <li>The event is awaiting approval.</li>
                <li>The event has been approved.</li>
                <li>The event has been rejected.</li>
                <li>Error</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Please note: Hazards can be created in Configuration. See section <MadCap:xref href="../3-01 Configuration/HazardsHierarchy.htm" class="Chapter_Section"><i>1.1  Building a Hazards Hierarchy</i></MadCap:xref> for more details.</p>
