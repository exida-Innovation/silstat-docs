Note that mitigating factors, such as the probability of personnel presence or of emergency evacuation, are conditional modifiers  and not enabling conditions. The term enabling event is sometimes used for enabling condition. The term enabling condition is preferred, since enabling conditions are not generally events but rather conditional states.</p>

Assume a calculated Required Risk Reduction Factor of 29, which would fall in the 10 - 100 Risk Reduction range. With a SIL Threshold Ratio of 1, a calculated Risk Reduction Factor of 29 would result in a Target SIL of SIL 2. The calculated Risk Reduction Factor is in this case greater than the SIL determination threshold which lies at 10 (10 * 1). With a SIL Threshold Ratio of 3, a calculated Risk Reduction Factor of 29 would result in a Target SIL of SIL 1. The calculated Risk Reduction Factor is in this case less than the SIL determination threshold which lies at 30 (10 * 3).</p>

Per IEC 61511 users of existing hardware either need to select hardware that is developed and assessed per IEC 61508 or justify the use of that hardware. The objective of the assessment or justification is to identify that there are “no” systematic problems with the equipment item under consideration. Systematic failure protection is part of IEC 61508 compliant development processes, alternatively sufficient recorded experience can also be used to identify that there is no known systematic problem.</p>
