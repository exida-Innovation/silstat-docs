        <h1 class="NoNumber">Disclaimer and Assumptions</h1>
        <p>Limitations and assumptions associated with the use of SILstat™ are documented in the following sections.</p>
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>The user of the exSILentia® SILstat™ software is responsible to ensure that all data is entered correctly into the SILstat™ database. Calculations are performed per guidelines in applicable international standards and common methods described in subject matter literature. <i>exida Innovation LLC</i> accepts no responsibility for the correctness of the regulations, standards, or literature on which the software tool is based.</p>
        <p>In particular, <i>exida Innovation LLC</i> accepts no liability for decisions based on the results of the  exSILentia® SILstat™ software. The <i>exida Innovation LLC</i> guarantee is restricted to the correction of errors or deficiencies within a reasonable period when such errors or deficiencies are brought to the attention of <i>exida Innovation LLC</i> in writing. <i>exida Innovation LLC</i> accepts no responsibility for adjustments made by the user to any reports and exports automatically generated by the exSILentia®  SILstat™ software.</p>
        <h4>Assumptions exida SERH Database</h4>
        <p><i>exida</i> has compiled a proprietary equipment failure database. This database is a compilation of failure data collected from detailed predictive analysis performed through Failure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostics Analysis (FMEDA) for specific manufacturer specific products and a variety of public and confidential sources. The failure rate data presents an average worst-case estimate of failure rates to be expected during normal operation of a particular equipment item. The database is published as the “Safety Equipment Reliability Handbook, fourth edition” ISBN 978-1-934977-15-6. The reliability data collection process is described in the SERH book.</p>
        <p>The user is responsible for determining the applicability of the failure data to any particular environment. The stress levels assumed to determine the equipment failure rate are average worst-case for an industrial environment and are documented in the SERH&#160;book. Accurate plant specific data is preferable to general industry average data. Industrial plant sites with high levels of stress must use failure rate data that is adjusted to a higher value to account for the specific conditions of the plant.</p>
        <h4>Assumptions SILstat™</h4>
        <p>To correctly calculate actual performance-based parameters, it is essential that all data is entered correctly and completely into the SILstat™ database.</p>
        <p>When determining failure rates, SILstat™ assumes that 1) all failure records are assigned to a device, 2) all devices are assigned to a device model, and 3) all device models are assigned to a device type. Failure to assign failure records, device, or device models will yield optimistic results.</p>
        <p>When determining event frequencies, SILstat™ assumes that 1) all events are recorded and 2) all events are assigned to a hazard scenario. Failure to assign event records or hazard scenarios will yield optimistic results.</p>
        <p>When determining demand rates and probability of failures, SILstat™ assumes that 1) all events are recorded, 2) all events are assigned to a hazard scenario, and 3) all corrective actions are adequately documented. Failure to assign event records, hazard scenarios, or corrective actions will yield optimistic results.</p>
        <p>When providing a list of procedures due or procedures overdue, SILstat™ assumes that the status of all procedures is kept up to date within the SILstat™ database.</p>
