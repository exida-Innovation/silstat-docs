        <p>Your site hierarchy can be configured in SILstat’s Configuration section. The hierarchy can be created upon import of your exSILentia project files or built directly within SILstat. Here, the hierarchy between Areas, Process Areas, Units, Equipment, Hazard Scenarios, Safeguards, Tags, and Procedures can be defined. This hierarchy has four different views  :</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Physical</li>
                <li>Hazards</li>
                <li>Safeguards</li>
                <li>Procedures</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Hierarchies can be completed in any order, though the order listed above gives you the most complete information as you move through the workflows.</p>
        <p>After clicking into Configuration, if you have not previously chosen an initial Hierarchy, SILstat will prompt you to choose between the Hierarchy views.</p>
        <p>To control the hierarchy view, select the &lt;&lt; button to expand and collapse the hierarchy panel. Select the two horizontal bars to expand the panel vertically or horizontally.</p>
        <p>Above the hierarchy is a dedicated Search function, which searches items in the Configurations. The Sort function allows you to sort items in the hierarchy alphabetically.</p>
        <p>The next button shows which hierarchy view is selected and allows you to switch between views. When you switch views, your place in the previous view is saved for a time. If you select a new view, you will start at the top of the hierarchy.</p>
