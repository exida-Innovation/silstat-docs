            Failure Events</h2>
        <p>Failure Events can be initiated in the Collection section, by selecting the <i>Failure</i> button. Alternatively, Failure Events can be initiated by navigating through the hierarchy and selecting the failed Device. See section <MadCap:xref href="RecordingEvents.htm" class="Chapter_Section"><i>1.1  
            Recording Events</i></MadCap:xref> for Event options included in each Hierarchy view. Finally, Failure Events may be initiated after a failed Procedure Event or a Hazard Event.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Once initiated, the Failure Event view will show on the right-hand side of the application. Here you can specify the details of the event:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Where</b> section allows you to specify the failed Device. For Events initiated through the hierarchy, the selected device will be listed. If not yet specified, select the ‘Select Where’ button. A plant hierarchy view will appear in a panel to the far right. Navigate through the hierarchy to find the failed Device. Once finished with your selection, press Next. An indication that the step is complete is shown, and the section will collapse to show the next step.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">When</b> section allows you to specify the Failure Date. By default, the date is the current date. You can select the ‘Show Time’ toggle switch to enter a Time. You can select the ‘Date Range’ toggle switch to specify a Start and End date. By default, the date range is one day. Once finished with your selection, press Next. An indication that the step is complete is shown, and the section will collapse to show the next step.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">How</b> or <b style="font-style: italic;">Why</b> (if the Failure Event is associated with a Hazard Event) section refers to how the failure occurred. The Detection Method can be chosen from a drop-down menu.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Failure Classifications</b> section provides a grid showing the Device associated with the Failure Event. The Tag, Name, and Device Type are shown. Here you can specify the Failure Classification from a drop-down list.</li>
                <li>The <b style="font-style: italic;">Details</b> section includes all relevant information for this event. You can specify a Name, Description, and include Common Properties (Custom Data, Resources, References, Labels) for the event.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once each section is completed, press Confirm at either the top or bottom of the screen. As SILstat processes the event, the following notifications may be provided:</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>The event is queued for processing.</li>
                <li>The event has been successfully completed.</li>
                <li>The event is awaiting approval.</li>
                <li>The event has been approved.</li>
                <li>The event has been rejected.</li>
                <li>Error</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once the Failure Event is confirmed / occurred, you have the option to repair or replace the affected device. See section <MadCap:xref href="EventRepair.htm" class="Chapter_Section_NumberOnly"><i>1.1 </i></MadCap:xref> for Repair Events and Section <MadCap:xref href="EventReplace.htm" class="Chapter_Section_NumberOnly"><i>1.1 </i></MadCap:xref> for Replace Events.</p>
        <p>Please note: Failure Classifications can be specified in SILstat Settings. See <MadCap:keyword term="TBD" /><span style="background-color: #ffd700;">Section XXX</span> for more details.</p>
