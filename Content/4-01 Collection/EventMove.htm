        <p>Move Events allow you to reconfigure the hierarchy after installation. Configuration permissions are required for these events. Move Events can be initiated in the Collection section, by selecting <i>Area Lifecycle</i> or <i>Device Lifecycle</i> buttons, then selecting <i>Move</i> from the drop-down. Alternatively, Move Events can be initiated by navigating through the hierarchy and selecting a Node to be moved. See section <MadCap:xref href="RecordingEvents.htm" class="Chapter_Section"><i>1.1  
            Recording Events</i></MadCap:xref> for Event options included in each Hierarchy view.</p>
