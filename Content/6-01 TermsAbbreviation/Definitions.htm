Per IEC 61511 users of existing hardware either need to select hardware that is developed and assessed per IEC 61508 or justify the use of that hardware. The objective of the assessment or justification is to identify that there are “no” systematic problems with the equipment item under consideration. Systematic failure protection is part of IEC 61508 compliant development processes, alternatively sufficient recorded experience can also be used to identify that there is no known systematic problem.</p>

For functional safety applications, devices are expected to be replaced at the end of their useful life.</p>
