        <p>SILstat™ is the life event recording module of the exSILentia® Safety Lifecycle tool. Used during operation and maintenance, SILstat™ provides insight to the performance of your safety systems on site, simplifying the collection of critical data, and contextualizing results for comparison of key metrics to assumptions made during your SIS design.</p>
        <p>SILstat leverages your project work from PHA, LOPA, SRS, SIL Verification and Proof Test definition for easy database configuration. This builds a dynamic plant hierarchy that captures the physical location of your safeguard devices as well as the logical relationship between elements of your safety functions.</p>
        <p>SILstat gives context to data collected on process demands, proof tests, failures, and repairs. With curated Dashboards, Insights, and Reports, performance metrics are communicated to key personnel throughout a team or organization. The table below provides an example of event data and the output metrics.</p>

        <p>With the information recorded you can determine if the performance metrics you assumed during the Analysis and Design and Implementation phases of the Safety Lifecycle adequately represent actual performance. In case actual performance is better than predicted you can argue that your SIF is over-designed to protect against a specific hazard. This would allow modification of the design and required risk reduction implementation in future applications and can provide potential cost savings. In case actual performance is worse than expected, the process hazard might represent a higher risk than originally estimated, or the SIF does not perform as well as expected. In this case additional risk reduction measures must be implemented to ensure tolerable risk targets are met.</p>

        <p>Part 1 of this user guide provides this introduction, including an overview of what to expect when launching the SILstat software. the various license platforms and installation of the software on a local PC, as well as a high level overview of each of the software  modules within the exSILentia® Software. Part 2 covers all steps needed to getting you started using the SILstat software ranging from initial setup of the SILstat environment to an understanding on how data is stored with SILstat. Part 3 provides detailed guidance on the configuration tasks for SILstat, this includes setting up the various hierarchies and defining devices that data is collected on. Part 4 describes how data is collected using SILstat, ranging from recording hazards / initiating events and device failures to performing proof tests and maintenance activities. Part 5 describes how the data that is collected can be analyzed either through review of teh SILstat dashboard or through pre-defined reports. Part 6 covers Abbreviations, Terms and Definitions, Disclaimer and Assumptions as well as the exSILentia® Software License Agreement and an Index.</p>
